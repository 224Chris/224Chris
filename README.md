I'm Chris
I love Music. Tyler, the creator,Dave,Kendrick Lamar. My big 3. Argue with me.
I'm a computer science student.
I'd love the complexity of learning how computers work but realizing how simple it is when you grasp a particular process.
I intrigued by art, well written codes and some other computer stuff.
I want to learn as much as possible to get a good job and eat rice all day.
